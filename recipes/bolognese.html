        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This homemade Bolognese sauce is dedicated to the late great Marcella Hazan. She was considered the Julia Child of Italian food. At a time when most Americans thought Bolognese was spaghetti sauce with chunks of hamburger, Marcella taught us just how magnificent this meat sauce could be.</p>
        <p>I like to toss it with some mezzi rigatoni and serve it with a little grated Parmesan cheese and a sprinkle of parsley.</p> 
       
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>2 </strong> tablespoons butter</li>
            <li><strong>1 </strong>tablespoon olive oil            </li>
            <li><strong>1 </strong>cup finely diced onion</li>
            <li><strong>Â½ cup </strong>chopped parsley</li>
            <li><strong>1 </strong>1 pinch salt</li>
            <li><strong>1</strong> pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p><strong>Step 1</strong></p>
        <p>Melt butter with olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add onion, celery, carrot, and 1 pinch salt; cook and stir until onion turns translucent, about 5 minutes.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2</strong></p>
        <p>Stir ground beef into vegetables; cook and stir until meat is crumbly and no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Season with 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, nutmeg, cayenne pepper, and black pepper.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 3</strong></p>
        <p>Pour milk into ground beef mixture and bring to a simmer. Cook, stirring frequently, until most of the milk has evaporated and the bottom of the pan is still slightly saucy, about 5 minutes.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 4</strong></p>
        <p>Increase heat to medium-high and pour in white wine; cook and stir until wine has mostly evaporated, about 5 minutes.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 5</strong></p>
        <p>Pour tomatoes with juice into a large mixing bowl; crush them with your hands until they resemble a chunky sauce. Pour tomato mixture into ground beef mixture; fill the tomato can with 2 cups water and stir into sauce. Bring to a boil.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 6</strong></p>
        <p>Remove the meatballs and sausage from the sauce, and set aside to cool slightly, then chop coarsely. Spoon a thick layer of sauce into the bottom of a 9-by-12-inch lasagna pan. Cover with a layer of noodles. Spoon more sauce on top, then add a third of the meat and a third of the cheese mixture. Repeat for 2 more layers, using all the meat and cheese. Top with a layer of noodles, and cover with the remaining sauce. Sprinkle reserved mozzarella evenly over the top. Bake 30 minutes. Let stand 10 minutes before serving.</p>
